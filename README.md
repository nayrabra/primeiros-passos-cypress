# Cypress Automation

This project uses **Cypress** to automate end-to-end tests for the **Login**, **Menu**, and **My Info** features.  
Random test data is generated using **Chance.js**.

Cypress is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework that allows developers and QA engineers to write and run tests in a real browser environment.
